# Change-wall

Background python executable for changing desktop wallpaper like a slideshow. 

Things to do before running the wall.exe - 
1. Open info.txt
2. Replace the first line with the directory containing cool images.
3. Replace the second line with the number of seconds of delay between changing the wallpaper to the next image.
4. Run wall.exe

If you wish to stop the slideshow, Please use the task manager to end the 'wall.exe' task.

PS - Windows does the wallpaper slideshow by default. Just for fun, I reinvented the wheel.
